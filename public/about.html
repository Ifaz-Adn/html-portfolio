<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! <br />
  This is Ifaz Ahmed Adan an Electrical and Eloctronic Engineering Graduate. I have passed my bachelors with honours in 2024
  from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology also known as CUET. My academic background is in fact one of the most 
  classical backgrounds for a Chittagonian.

<p>
  Saint Mary's School was my primary school. Then I studied in Chittagong Collegiate School and passed my secondary school certificate
  exam (SSC) from there. Then I moved to Chittagong College and passed my intermediate from there. These two institutions have pretty 
  good reputations. Lots of pioneers of our country as well as of the world are graduates of these institutions. For example: the Nobel 
  laurate D. Muhammad Yunus was a student of both Chittagong Collegiate School and Chittagong College.
